This program was made to be able to run python analysis of Matlab data easily.

You might have experienced the need to analyse Matlab data with one of your python script, and not having time to waste to write again the analysing program in Matlab.

This program takes as input data from Matlab, an analysing python script, and gives as output the processed data in Matlab.

The two main files are : OpenPython.m and basic_data_analysis.py.
